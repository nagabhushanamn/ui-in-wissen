Arch.. design issues  with 'react.js' only
------------------------------------------



===> state/model/ui-data is scattered across UI components
===> state & state-change logic & network/service calls 
     are tightly-coupled with UI components
===> if same state is required in multiple components 
     either we should duplicate that state in components 
     or we should pass via input properties      
===> Unit-Testing is very difficult in components
===> we cant re-use same components across different pages 
     or applications     



solution:

==> isolate common state & state change logic & n/wing logic 
    from UI components


How ?

way-1 : using MVC pattern

    --> bi-directional data-flow b/w view & state/model

way-2 : Flux pattern  ( from facebook )

    --> uni-directional data-flow b/w view & state/model
